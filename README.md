# Squad Topographic Maps

This repository contains hand-drawn topographic recreations of maps inspired by the game Squad. These maps aim to enhance clarity and usability for the community by providing detailed terrain information, all created using standardized topographic mapping techniques. While accuracy and adherence to these techniques are important, equal care has been taken to ensure the maps are visually appealing, blending functionality with a touch of style befitting a videogame setting.

## Workflow

Here’s an overview of the process used to create these maps:

1. **Extracting Map Data**
   - Using the *Squad* SDK to gather essential data, including heightmaps, map resolution, scale, size, and features.
   - Analyzing in-game features such as roads, rivers, buildings, forests, and terrain types for accurate placement.

2. **Generating Base Layers in QGIS**
   - Importing heightmap data to create contour lines and hillshading.
   - Adjusting contour intervals and hillshade settings to ensure clarity and alignment with topographic mapping standards.

3. **Hand-Editing with Inkscape**
   - Using vector tools to manually place or draw roads, buildings, rivers, forests, and other critical features.
   - Ensuring accuracy by cross-referencing in-game visuals and real-world mapping principles.

4. **Polishing in Photoshop**
   - Enhancing the map’s visual appeal with color adjustments, layer blending, and custom effects.
   - Applying standardized symbols, labels, and color schemes for a professional and readable finish.
